#Events Controller

##A Sinatra app built for Flaitiron. 

#TODO
#Add sidebar to My Events page (Add event)
#Add categories
#Add sort to events and My events pages
#Add attendees/Event Status
##Need to determine relationship. An event status belongs to a user and an event. An event has many event statuses and a User has many events. Does an event have many users through an event status? Can a model have two types of relationships with another model?  
#Sort by location/Location events page?
#Seed more events -- pagination
